This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## Prompts
1. File Upload
I created the nextjs project within `img-to-text-with-windsurf/frontend`. Help me implementing the **File Upload** feature. Note, we'll work on `img-to-text-with-windsurf/backend` after that.
```bash
# Install additional dependencies
npm install react-dropzone --save

# Run server
npm run dev
```
