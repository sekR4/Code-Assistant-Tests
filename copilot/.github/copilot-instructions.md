### Project overview

A small locally running nice looking web app that accepts an image as input through an UI and returns a description of the image.
Technologies Used:

-   Next.js 15+ as framework
-   TypeScript for type safety
-   Tailwind CSS for styling
-   FastAPI as backend (calling ollama model)

-   Error handling with user-friendly notifications

**Image to Text**

-   Automatically image gets described
-   Server-side (so here my local host) processing with temporary file storage

**Result Display**
